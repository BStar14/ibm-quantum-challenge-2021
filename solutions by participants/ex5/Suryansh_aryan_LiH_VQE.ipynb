Our main motive is to reduce the computational cost as well as getting a decent amount of accuracy and so keeping this in mind, for the configuration of 3,4 orbitals removal as well as z2symmetry I came to the result after numerous iterations that, parameters for TwoLocal with linear entanglement hving RX, RY and CX gates and repeated only onces with RY and RZ gates filling the final layer gives a decent accuracy in resulting energy value with just cost of 3, only 3 CX gates used.\n","\n","Also it was noticed that for VQE to successfully reach to the exact energy value, all qubits used must be entangled(CX) with each other atleast and so as this configuration uses 4 qubits, hence I could reduce my cost to just 3.
